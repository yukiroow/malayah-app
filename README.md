#### The Problem
- According to research, many Filipinos facing mental health issues feel unsafe or hesitant to seek help due to stigma or fear of judgment. These individuals consider professional therapy and counseling as inaccessible and costly. This leaves a gap in mental health support especially for young people, who needs safe, affordable and accessible resources that could help them with their mental health journey. 

#### The Solution
- The solution is to develop an AI emotional support chatbot for users to feel safe in seeking help for their mental health issues without fear of judgement and worrying about high costs. This would provide young people with someone that would they can converse with, free of judgement and would hopefully help to ease some of the struggles in their lives.
